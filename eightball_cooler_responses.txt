[USER] says you're a dipshit. It's a big fat no.
How should I know? Go ask [USER].
I just asked [USER] and they said that you're stupid for asking.
Maybe you should ask [USER] instead...
Yeah, totally. It's gonna happen. Like, duh.
No doubt, dude. It's a done deal. Snap snap.
You betcha. No ifs, ands, or butts.
Of course, dude. It's a no-brainer.
Don't worry, I got your back. It's a sure thing.
Yeah, it's looking good. I'm seeing green, like money.
Probably. But, you know, things can change. Just sayin'.
It's gonna be awesome. Like, totally awesome.
Yep. Yep yep yep.
The stars are aligned. It's destiny.
Nope. Not gonna happen. Get over it.
My spies say you're a dipshit. It's a big fat no.
Uh oh. It's not looking good. Maybe you should just give up.
Like, super doubtful. You're gonna be disappointed.
I'm not sure. Ask me later. Maybe after I eat.
I'm busy right now. Come back later. Maybe after I finish this sandwich.
It's a secret. But I'm not telling you. Maybe I'll tell you later.
I'm not a fortune teller. Give me your lunch money, and maybe I'll tell you.
Think hard. Really hard. And then ask me again. Maybe I'll give you a different answer.
Not a chance.
Nope, and don’t get your hopes up.
Doesn’t look good for you.
Yeah, don’t bet on that.
Ask me later, I’m busy.
Try again, but with less whining.
I’m keeping that answer to myself.
How should I know? Ask someone else.
Focus and ask properly next time.
No question about it.
Obviously, yeah.
You’d better believe it.
For sure.
Count on it.
Looks like a yes from where I’m standing.
Chances are solid.
Things are looking good.
Yeah, duh.
All signs scream ‘yes.’
